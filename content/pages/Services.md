My goal is to empower your company to extract value from your data. Please reach out at my social
 accounts - I would love to hear from you.

I specialize in both product-based and strategic consulting and production.

## Development of Data-Driven Products
If you have ever logged into Netflix, searched for an image on Google, or received an email with a coupon, then you have experienced a data-driven product. The core of these products is a computer algorithm that ingests historical data to learn how to drive future outcomes. I have built and deployed many of these systems and love helping companies ship these types of products. My services cover the gamut of product development: defining requirements, mathematical modeling and prototyping, writing production code, deployment, and experimentation.

For companies with no data scientists, I am happy to build a product from scratch. For companies with data scientists, I quickly ramp up and contribute to the product roadmap. Sometimes, there is significant friction in converting data scientists’ models into production-ready engineering solutions. Engineers are unable to understand the data scientists’ math and code, and the data scientists are not versed in software engineering best-practices. In these cases, I excel in bridging that gap by refactoring the scientific code into a well-tested, deployable solution.

If you are considering (or struggling) building data-driven products, then let’s talk.
