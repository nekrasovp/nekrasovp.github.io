Summary: Five ways to help users become more data-driven in order to guarantee the success of your analytics project

## Abstract

When it comes to analytics, most people focus on the technology side of the house. Yet
soft skills have emerged as the unsung heroes of successful business analysis projects.
And one of the top soft skills in demand is the ability for technical teams to help
business users become data driven.
A key enabler of data-driven users is modern analytics technology that
enables them to foster their data curiosity and engage in an ongoing conversation with
data. But, even with a modern analytics platform, IT still needs to educate users—who,
whether from frustration or ignorance, aren’t delving into data on their own—how to
identify, manipulate, and leverage key data in order to make better business decisions.

## Analytics user experience, not the requirements

The status quo right now in analytics is for a user to
request a report and IT to deliver it. But that approach
rarely yields true business insight. That’s because
business users often can’t articulate what they want
because they simply don’t know what’s possible.
Or—even worse—they’ve been conditioned not to ask
for anything exemplary because it’s too hard, if not
downright impossible, to deliver it.

Instead of focusing on what users think they need,
users need to first ask themselves how what they
need plays into the analytics user experience. And,
as IT, you need to stop the mindless task of building
only the reports requested by users. With this new
approach, you’ll be able to foresee what the user’s
next request might be, prevent problems about
how to slice and dice the data, and create improved
analytics processes that eliminate the need for users
to manually manipulate the data you deliver—such as
by joining together multiple, disparate reports in Excel.

Find out:

- What business problem is the user trying to solve? What’sthe business context for the information?
- What are users doing right now to try to get the information they need? What isn’t working with that approach?
- How will the information be used?
- How familiar will users be with the report?
- Do users need visual indicators, such as labels, on the report?
- Do users need training materials within the report?

## Think generically, not specifically

It may seem counterintuitive, but you need to
think generically, not specifically, when it comes to
modern analytics. Legacy analytics tools fostered an
environment where users were conditioned to request
and then stitch together their own separate reports.
This process is neither accurate nor scalable, and it
creates redundant work resulting in mismatched data.

Instead, help users understand what they need the
end result to be, so you can connect data for them
in such a way that multiple variations of the same
analysis don’t have to be built.

For instance, ask them:

- Can we create a larger data view of this
information? Is there a way we can set up this
analysis to provide the most data and have
access to the right things?
- Can we implement security to make one generic
model—a semantic description of the data set—
to be used for multiple things?
- Can we develop one master dashboard that
uses filtering capabilities to let people slice and
dice the data however they want, for self-service
analytics?
- What’s the next question or questions the
information is likely to elicit?

## Understand that tables and charts go together

Two core types of visual analysis are used today:
tables and charts. Tables display actual numbers,
but the eye has a hard time spotting trends in tables
and correlating those numbers with large data sets.
Charts, on the other hand, focus on visual storytelling
but often don’t give the level of detail required
because they don’t let users dig into the numbers
behind the graphics.

What’s really needed is a happy merger of the two—
much like peanut butter and jelly: pictures that help
users understand aggregated data, coupled with the
ability to drill into the row level transactions that make
up the chart.

With this approach, you:

- Help your audience quickly and clearly
understand the data and insights;
- Let users quickly identify and discount outliers
from their analysis, or dig deeper to understand
and learn from the outliers; and
- Tell a more powerful story because you deliver
at-a-glance understanding of high-level data via
visualization capabilities while enabling users
to validate and gain additional context into
specific data.

## Ensure your analytics solution lays a fopundation for future artificial intelligence

Even if your organization doesn’t yet know what it
might do with AI, it’s important to plan for it. That
means investing only in modern analytics technology
that can support future AI needs, rather than relying
upon old tech stack capabilities. Lay the foundation
now, so you can do what you need to do in the future.

## Track your analytics usage to make smarter future investments

It’s the norm in analytics to build and deliver reports
yet have no insight into if they’re actually valuable or
used regularly. Looked at another way—do the people
who use analytics outperform others?

Unfortunately, reaching this level of analysis is
a luxury most organizations can’t afford. That’s
because most can’t even answer the basic question
of which reports are run or used, and they’re stuck in
an endless cycle of unmet requirements and delivery
expectations.

The questions they really need to answer surround
analytics usage and the resulting benefits, so they can
hold business users accountable to the report usage.
With this approach, you can force business users to
prioritize the reports they want delivered and their
timelines, as well as the reports they should retire to
keep the environment clean and productive

Ask questions like:

- Does the report people reference
five times per day actually make a
difference?
- Can you say people who use
dashboards outperform those who
don’t by X percent?
- How do you justify the dollar amount
and time invested in analytics
technology?
- How do you demonstrate the massive
impact you bring to the company to
convince leadership to invest more
money into analytics?

Implementing this new approach will help
your budgeting and planning exercise
for the next fiscal year, so you can make
smarter future investments. It also will
require both leadership and business users
to assume accountability for their report
requests. As a result, both business and IT
leadership will thank you for it and together
will unlock growth opportunities within the
organization.
